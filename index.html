<h1>Building APIs</h1>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building.png" width="175" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Urban areas account for 1.5% of global land use. We spend most of our time in buildings, while at home, work or shopping and at the library.</p>
<p>Buildings play a large role in our personal and professional lives.  Many buildings already have automated heating, air, electrical, water and other system. Many of these building manufacturers are understanding the importance of allowing API access to their hardware and software.</p>
<p>Imagine if all of our buildings thought for themselves, and were able to teach us to reduce energy consumption, diagnose problems in real-time, allowing them to self correct when necessary or call a service provider when they need repair or tuning.</p>
<p>In this section I will be tracking on news and companies that are doing interesting things around building and home maagement or automation APIs, while also sharing blog analysis as well.</p>
