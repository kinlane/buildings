<p>Individual vent covers will cost around $40 per vent, Keen predicts, with a $150 one-time charge for the system in total.There’s also another option, with a recurring fee of  $4 per month for access to the cloud-based management platform, which also provides monthly reports, plus a $25 sign up payment.But Fant and Hussain plan to partner with utility companies and homebuilders to try to offer the tech initially at a discount price, perhaps with, say, six months of service rolled into a new construction.It’s the same model that satellite radio provider Sirius/XM uses to sell subscriptions with new cars.Keen Home is launching its Keen Vent product on Indiegogo today, and believes that seeking crowdfunding, as well as traditional investment, will help it get the word out and prove product viability.</p>
