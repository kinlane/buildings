{% include JB/setup %}<p>Below you’ll find tutorials, code libraries and example code that will teach you how to use the Ninja Blocks platform, and reference documentation for all the moving parts.The Ninja Blocks REST API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE verbs.Each resource, like Block, Device, User or Rule, has its own URL and is manipulated in isolation.In other words, we’ve tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.All API usage happens through Ninja Blocks applications, created by either Ninja owners for their own devices, or by 3rd Party Developers for use by the Ninja Blocks community.</p>
