<p>I had a chance to talk with the Johnson Controls, Panoptix API team this last week.The Panoptix® community offers: a combination of software and services that easily and cost-effectively helps customers see more so they can do more to achieve optimized building performance and energy efficiency To understand what Panoptix enables.imagine if all of our buildings: Thought for themselves Teach us to reduce energy consumption Diagnose problems in real-time Self correct when necessary Call a service provider when they need repair or tuning Panoptix starts with a cloud-hosted platform that enables buildings to collect and manage data, along with tools for automating operations at the building and space levels providing metering for electricity, water, gas oil steam, carbon and weather--with very granular level reporting up to overall trends of energy use.To grow Panoptix, Johnson Controls introduced a marketplace of apps combined with supporting news, information, resources and entire community dedicated to building performance and efficiency management.This marketplace and community is driven by an API developer area, allowing anyone to sign up and get to work developing apps and start selling them in the Panoptix marketplace.</p>
