<p>When I last talked with the Panoptix API team over at Johnson Controls (JCI), they were working hard on new features, including the possibility of writing data to the building efficiency API(s).A year later, I wanted to see where the team was at with their API efforts and was intrigued to learn that their work to make their API writable hadn’t gone exactly as they had planned.On the surface it sounds like an easy task.You can pull data from an API, now using POST, PUT and DELETE you should be able to write data back into the system.Easier said than done, says John Bernd (@jkbernd) and Simone Vigano (@viganosimone)  of the Panoptix API team.</p>
