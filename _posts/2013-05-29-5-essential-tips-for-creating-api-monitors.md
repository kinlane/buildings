{% include JB/setup %}<p>As we have dwelled upon in a number of previous posts here at SmartBear, creating monitors for APIs you either provide or consume (or both) should be a cornerstone in your online quality strategy.Now that API Monitoring has a free version you hardly have any excuses left – right?Actually, one of those last excuses stopping you from setting up your first (free) API monitor might be that you don’t really know what to consider and where to start when setting it up – so let’s remedy that in a pinch and get you going with some hands-on tips for creating your first API monitor.If you’re providing your own APIs then re-using functional API tests created during development and testing for monitoring has several advantages: Instead of just checking availability, “real” functionality of your API will be scrutinized continuously, providing you with a safety net for continuous deployment practices and infrastructure changes Given that your functional API tests are set up to assert and provide relevant error messages, the corresponding API monitors will have the ability to give you much more detailed error information for root cause analysis than regular availability monitors.Given that your functional API monitors mimic expected usage scenarios, their actual structure can tell Ops how your APIs are expected to be used, and help them set up the API infrastructure accordingly.</p>
