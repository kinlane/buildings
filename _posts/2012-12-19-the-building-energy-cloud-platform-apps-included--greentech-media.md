<p>We’ve been covering a flurry of technology partnerships on the smart grid-smart buildings front as of late -- demand response from Schneider Electric and IPKeys, building energy efficiency from EnerNOC and SCIenergy, and building data analytics from IBM, Honeywell and SkyFoundry among them.Indeed, pretty much every big building controls vendor has a cloud-based platform to back up their service-based energy services contracting (ESCO) work, with names like Schneider’s StruxureWare, Honeywell’s Attune, Siemens’ Apogee, and the like venturing into the space.Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls rolled out its own platform last year, called Panoptix, which mirrored its competitors’ platforms in tying together the heterogeneous, largely legacy technology of lots and lots of building control systems into an enterprise management and controls architecture of some kind.But Johnson Controls has also opened up its Panoptix platform in some interesting ways.The latest this month is a new applications developer program, aimed at inviting third-party software into the fold, with noteworthy building efficiency technology players like BuildingIQ, FirstFuel and Lucid Design Group already on board.</p>
