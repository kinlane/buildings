{% include JB/setup %}<p>Lucids Building Dashboard® is among the first building energy management apps launched on the Panoptix® building efficiency platform.By making Lucid’s advanced, real-time energy display technology available to its commercial customers, Johnson Controls is enabling them to put proven, energy-saving tools compatible with its energy-management products in the hands of building owners and managers.Using the Panoptix API, Lucid taps into the real-time data feed from Panoptix to transform raw energy consumption data into visually engaging widgets and graphical representations that engage building occupants, motivate behavior change, and give building managers continuous insight into energy-saving opportunities.The Panoptix cloud-based solution allows other companies to access building energy information and develop tools that customers can add to their energy management toolkit easily and at low cost.The release of Panoptix marks another major step as major automation and building technology companies move toward putting data in the cloud and making available open systems that third parties can access.</p>
