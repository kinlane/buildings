{% include JB/setup %}<p>This guest post comes from Lorinda Brandon, Director of Solutions Strategy at SmartBear Software.You can follow her on Twitter or find her blogging regularly at SmartBear.Last week, for the first time I had the opportunity to attend the Glue conference in Broomfield, CO.An aptly named conference, Glue’s mission is to provide a technical forum for web application builders, architects, and integrators to talk about the various technologies that stick together to make a web platform and its associated applications.It’s one of the most exciting and nerdy places you can go, and it’s well worth the investment if you’re in this industry.</p>
