{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was syncing up some of my OWS Network systems with the complementing Google systems today.Such as when you post a blog entry to your blog it will post to Blogger, and when you post an calendar entry to your web site it automatically publishes to Google Calendar.So I started working with the Google Data API, and I noticed when you click on code samples and references it just sends to directly to Zend Framework.They have created Zend GData which gives you read / write access to the Google Data APIs.It is a very nice set of PHP classes that allow you to work with Calendar, Spreadsheets, Blogger, CodeSearch, and Base.</p>
